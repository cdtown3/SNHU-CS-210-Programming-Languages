1. This project is created using C++ as a base language, with Java integrated into it. The program can be used to manage and keep track of animal RFID records. Users have the ability to generate txt files to hold animal records and their tracking number.
2. I feel that I was able to implement the base/derived class architecture well. It worked really well, and using a vector full of pointers, I was able to call derived class functions over base class functions.
3. I definitely think there are areas where I can make the code more efficient. I think I could create more functions so that I don't have so much copy and pasted code. I should also go back and ensure that my code has the best security implemented. Lastly, I think I need to learn how to manipulate and output text better using setw and setfill. 
4. I had to go back and check ZyBooks a few times when implementing the base class and derived classes. I had to make sure that the derived class's functions were taking priority over the base class. That was the only way to get the program to work, so I had to recheck how to use the virtual keyword. I also had to Google how to manipulate a string, like an output stream.
5. Understanding how to implement base/derived classes, pointers, string manipulation, and integrating other languages together are all skills from this project that will transfer to a job. I was really happy to get a better understanding of all of these concepts.
6. I made sure to create inline comments, simple to read variables and functions, and I created functions so that I didn't have to copy/paste code all over. The code is easier to change and understand when first looking at it.
